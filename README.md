### Integration
- Integrated backend and frontend, so signup and sign in are functional. Passwords are hashed, emails are not yet verified, however.
- Able to create exercises and create a schedule, will persist between logins and refreshes.
- Able to insert data for a specific exercise and a graph will generate from it (data is saved as well).
